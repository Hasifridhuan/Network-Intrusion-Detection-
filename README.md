# Network-Intrusion-Detection-
To detect anomalies detection of network intrusion: 

Denial of Service (DoS): is an attack in which an adversary directed a deluge of traffic requests to a system in order to make the computing or memory resource too busy or too full to handle legitimate requests and in the process, denies legitimate users access to a machine.
Probing Attack (Probe): probing network of computers to gather information to be used to compromise its security controls.
User to Root Attack (U2R): a class of exploit in which the adversary starts out with access to a normal user account on the system (gained either by sniffing passwords, a dictionary attack, or social engineering) and is able to exploit some vulnerability to gain root access to the system.
Remote to Local Attack (R2L): occurs when an attacker who has the ability to send packets to a machine over a network but who does not have an account on that machine exploits some vulnerability to gain local access as a user of that machine.
